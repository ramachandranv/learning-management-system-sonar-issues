# Environment Variables for Learning Management System
# Copy this file to .env (which should be in .gitignore)
# Set these values in your deployment environment

# Database Configuration
DB_USERNAME=lms_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here_min_12_chars
DB_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/lms

# Security Notes:
# 1. Use strong passwords (minimum 12 characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
# 2. Create dedicated database user with minimal required permissions
# 3. Use environment-specific values (dev/staging/prod)
# 4. Never commit actual credentials to version control
# 5. Consider using secret management services (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.)

# Example of strong password generation:
# openssl rand -base64 32
